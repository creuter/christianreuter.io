        <h1>Hello, I&rsquo;m Christian!</h1>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;m a product design &amp; UX research leader in Raleigh, NC, driving
          clarity, craft, and culture in high-growth companies creating
          intelligent products.

          <h2 id="about-heading">About</h2>
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m currently working remotely as the head of design at
            <a href="https://iterable.com">Iterable</a>, a
            marketing automation platform, where we help brands better communicate
            with their customers. It&rsquo;s an exciting space, with all sorts of
            interesting challenges around AI, big data, and tools for creation. I
            love getting to work with technology that&rsquo;s human-centered, makes
            people&rsquo;s jobs easier, and amplifies their creative potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Iterable, I&rsquo;ve scaled the design team, built our research
            and design systems practices, led complex AI and modernization efforts,
            and helped shape a multi-year product vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to that, I was the design director at
            <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>&rsquo;s
            Raleigh studio, where we built custom web and mobile applications for
            our clients around the Southeast.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m a full-stack generalist with a bias for clarity, momentum, and
            thoughtful systems. I care deeply about craft, continuous learning, and
            building cultures where people feel empowered to do their best
            work—especially in distributed environments.

              empower the product design team is what has made all of the UI/UX

          <p>
            At a time when the industry was rapidly evolving and our teams were
            navigating ambiguity, I led a cross-functional initiative to define
            and articulate Iterable&rsquo;s long-term product vision.
          </p>

          <p>My goal was threefold:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Align executives around a unified, customer-centered future</li>
            <li>Inspire the company and rally the team around a clear direction</li>
            <li>Position Iterable as a strategic, AI-first partner in the eyes of the market</li>
          </ul>

          <figure class="color-accent-0">
            <img src="images/vision/programs-2x.png" alt="Program management interface">
          </figure>

          <p>
            To do this, I assembled a working group that included our CEO, SVP
            of Product Marketing &amp; Partnerships, SVP of Engineering, and our
            SVP (later VP) of Product. I partnered closely with a UX researcher
            and a principal designer to explore bold ideas, test hypotheses, and
            iterate rapidly through vision drafts. Our process was deeply
            collaborative—with dozens of working sessions and ongoing
            stakeholder reviews to build buy-in.
          </p>

          <p>
            The centerpiece of the work was a live, in-browser interactive
            prototype: a forward-looking concept experience that tied together
            AI, automation, personalization, and scale. We demoed it at our
            company&rsquo;s fiscal year kickoff and later shared it publicly at
            our customer conference with over 1,000 attendees.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my proudest moments was presenting the vision on-stage to the
            entire company—followed by a live panel discussion alongside our
            CEO, VP of Product, and SVP of Engineering.
          </p>

            <img src="images/vision/journey-2x.png" alt="Customer journey mapping interface">

          <p>All this drove a few key outcomes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Influenced a reorg to dedicate R&amp;D resources toward long-term strategic work</li>
            <li>Drove alignment across product, engineering, and go-to-market teams</li>
            <li>Increased employee sentiment around leadership vision by <strong>19 percentage points</strong></li>
            <li>
              Sparked customer and market interest, including

            This project was a reminder of two of design&rsquo;s greatest superpowers,
            helping envision possible futures, and shaping what a company
            believes.

          <p>
            Predictive AI: One of our earliest AI features, Predictive Goals
            helps marketers forecast how likely an individual is to convert on a
            certain goal, allowing marketers to be more timely and relevant in
            their messaging.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea was born during a design sprint I facilitated with data
            scientists, product managers, engineers, and SMEs. We explored how
            we could surface predictive insights in a way that felt actionable
            and trustworthy. I led the MVP design and validated it with
            customers, ensuring we struck the right balance between simplicity
            and power.
          </p>

          <p>
            The impact was significant: Redfin saw a 72% lift in converting
            sellers to an active state, and BIG4 Holiday Parks reported a 156%
            boost in conversions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The feature has since evolved under my team’s guidance, and is now
            core to how many of our customers plan their campaigns. It’s become
            the foundation for how we bring predictive modeling into the hands
            of everyday marketers.

            actionable steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the primary design stakeholder, I focused on ensuring the
            experience felt clear, useful, and seamlessly integrated into a
            marketer’s workflow. I worked closely with the team to shape early
            concepts, provide iterative feedback, and protect the bar for quality
            through launch.

            <strong>Designing a Modern Foundation for Growth:</strong>
            As Iterable scaled to meet the needs of modern marketers, our
            platform’s UI had started to show its age—visually inconsistent,
            functionally fragmented, and increasingly difficult to evolve. We knew
            it was time for a foundational transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I led a company-wide modernization initiative, aligning design,
            engineering, and product around a shared goal: evolve the product
            experience without disrupting what customers already loved. We named
            this effort Aurora, symbolizing a fresh start with clarity and warmth
            at its core.
          </p>

            <strong>Balancing Familiarity with Progress:</strong>
            Modernization isn’t just about aesthetics, it’s about creating a
            coherent, resilient foundation for future innovation. We rebuilt the
            UI from the ground up: introducing a new design system, refreshing the
            visual language, improving accessibility, and reducing cognitive load
            across key workflows. But we did it with care—making incremental
            changes, validating decisions with customers, and preserving core
            interaction patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach minimized disruption while steadily raising the bar for
            product quality.

            <strong>Laying the Groundwork for the Future:</strong>
            Aurora was a mindset shift. We invested in scalable systems and
            patterns, enabling teams to build faster and more confidently.
            Alongside the visual upgrade, we fostered stronger cross-functional
            collaboration and raised internal expectations for craft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, this modernization effort continues to fuel Iterable’s
            evolution, shaping how we build, test, and design across the
            platform. It’s been one of our most impactful and far-reaching design
            initiatives, and one that continues to pay dividends.

          <p>
            Great design happens when people feel safe to take risks, push
            boundaries, and grow together. At Iterable, I cultivated a culture
            rooted in trust and collaboration, enabling our team to thrive in a
            fast-paced, distributed environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Product Design Team Charter reflects these shared principles:
            communicate candidly, support each other, and raise the bar for
            quality, all while staying kind and inclusive. This culture helped us
            achieve a <strong>team engagement score of 100%</strong>, 21
            percentage points above the company average.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
            Trust and excellence go hand in hand. I worked across product,
            engineering, and customer teams to ensure design was seen as a
            dependable, non-blocking partner. By facilitating collaboration and
            creating clarity, I helped the team consistently deliver with
            precision and creativity. Our focus on Clarity, Autonomy, Meaning,
            Progress, and Social Inclusion ensured the team felt supported and
            energized, even while holding ourselves to best-in-class standards.
          </p>

          <p>
            This culture of trust shaped not just how we worked with each other
            but also how we designed for our users. We led with empathy, deeply
            understanding customer needs and challenges, while upholding a strong
            sense of accountability to ship thoughtful, high-quality experiences.
            Internally and externally, trust has been the cornerstone of raising
            the bar for what design can achieve.
