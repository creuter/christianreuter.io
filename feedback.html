          &ldquo;Christian is a seasoned leader who takes initiative before any is
          requested. He has stepped into very ambiguous strategic conversations
          with great confidence. Through his leadership and facilitation we are
          able to come to critical clarity. I believe Christian is one of the
          most thoughtful partners across the org when it comes to distilling
          key components of strategic thought specific to our platform and in
          collaboration across the org.&rdquo;

          &ldquo;Over the past year, Christian has done a uniquely impressive
          job steering Iterable toward the future. He led our new design system
          creation, spearheaded scaling our user research approach, led new
          product concepts design sprints, championed product design principles.
          He keeps the team aligned, cuts through ambiguity, approaches
          challenges with a smile and kindness for everyone around him. He's a
          secret weapon, and we're lucky to have him.&rdquo;

          &ldquo;There are so many areas where I feel Christian truly excels in
          his role, but the number one thing has to be his ability to empower
          the people he manages. As director of product design, his ability to
          empower the product design team is what has made all of the UI/UX
          improvements possible and it’s why we continue to see an influx of
          customer compliments about our product’s usability. His leadership and
          genuine care for the people and products he oversees comes through in
          every meeting and every decision he makes. Even through our current
          turbulent times, where he’s having to manage more than ever, he
          continues to excel and pushes us all to be better each and every day.
          Iterable is lucky to have Christian and I’m lucky I get to work with
          and learn from him.&rdquo;

          don't work out, or if he doesn't agree.
          He's so good at making people feel seen and heard-not because it's
          some kind of trick he's good at, but because he's genuinely interested
          and curious in ideas that aren't his own.&rdquo;
