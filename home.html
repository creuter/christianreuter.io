      <h1 class="large-title">Hello, I'm Christian!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a product design &amp; UX research leader in Raleigh, NC who drives
        clarity, craft, and culture at the heart of high-growth, intelligent
        platforms.

      <!-- About -------------------------------------------------------------->
      <section aria-labelledby="about-heading">
        <h2 id="about-heading">About</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently working remotely as the head of design at
          <a href="https://iterable.com">Iterable</a>, a
          marketing automation platform, where we help brands better communicate
          with their customers. It's an exciting space, with all sorts of
          interesting challenges around AI, big data, and tools for creation. I
          love getting to work with technology that's human-centered, makes
          people's jobs easier, and amplifies their creative potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Iterable, I've scaled the design team, built our research
          and design systems practices, led complex AI and modernization efforts,
          and helped shape a multi-year product vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to that, I was the design director at
          <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>'s
          Raleigh studio, where we built custom web and mobile applications for
          our clients around the Southeast.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a full-stack generalist with a bias for clarity, momentum, and
          thoughtful systems. I care deeply about craft, continuous learning, and
          building cultures where people feel empowered to do their best
          work—especially in distributed environments.

            &ldquo;Christian is a seasoned leader who takes initiative before any is
            requested. He has stepped into very ambiguous strategic conversations
            with great confidence. Through his leadership and facilitation we are
            able to come to critical clarity. I believe Christian is one of the
            most thoughtful partners across the org when it comes to distilling
            key components of strategic thought specific to our platform and in
            collaboration across the org.&rdquo;

            &ldquo;Over the past year, Christian has done a uniquely impressive
            job steering Iterable toward the future. He led our new design system
            creation, spearheaded scaling our user research approach, led new
            product concepts design sprints, championed product design principles.
            He keeps the team aligned, cuts through ambiguity, approaches
            challenges with a smile and kindness for everyone around him. He's a
            secret weapon, and we're lucky to have him.&rdquo;

          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;There are so many areas where I feel Christian truly excels in
            his role, but the number one thing has to be his ability to empower
            the people he manages. As director of product design, his ability to
            empower the product design team is what has made all of the UI/UX
            improvements possible and it's why we continue to see an influx of
            customer compliments about our product's usability. His leadership and
            genuine care for the people and products he oversees comes through in
            every meeting and every decision he makes. Even through our current
            turbulent times, where he's having to manage more than ever, he
            continues to excel and pushes us all to be better each and every day.
            Iterable is lucky to have Christian and I'm lucky I get to work with
            and learn from him.&rdquo;
