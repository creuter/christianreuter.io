      <h1>Hello, I’m Christian!</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a digital product designer living in Raleigh, NC with my wife, two
        boys, and dog. I’ve designed interfaces for the past ~15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently working remotely as the head of design at
        <a href="https://iterable.com">Iterable</a>, a
        marketing automation platform, where we help brands better communicate
        with their customers. It’s an exciting space, with all sorts of
        interesting challenges around AI, big data, and tools for creation. I
        love getting to work with technology that's human-centered, makes
        people’s jobs easier, and amplifies their creative potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Iterable, I was the design director at
        <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>’s
        Raleigh studio, where we built custom web and mobile applications for
        our clients around the Southeast.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a “full-stack” generalist, interested in scaling quality, culture,
        and innovation for high-functioning, distributed design teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m getting better at woodworking and flower gardening.
        I play a lot of Sudoku, and love kayaking in the coastal Carolinas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always enjoy connecting with designers and other makers. <a
          href="mailto:hello@christianreuter.io">Shoot me an email</a> if
        you’re in the area, working on an interesting project, or have thoughts
        on remote design work! I’d love to chat.
