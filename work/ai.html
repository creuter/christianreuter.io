            <strong>Predictive AI:</strong>
            One of our earliest AI features, Predictive Goals helps marketers
            forecast how likely an individual is to convert on a certain goal,
            allowing marketers to be more timely and relevant in their messaging.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea was born during a design sprint I facilitated with data
            scientists, product managers, engineers, and SMEs. We explored how
            we could surface predictive insights in a way that felt actionable
            and trustworthy. I led the MVP design and validated it with
            customers, ensuring we struck the right balance between simplicity
            and power.
          </p>

          <p>
            The impact was significant: Redfin saw a 72% lift in converting
            sellers to an active state, and BIG4 Holiday Parks reported a 156%
            boost in conversions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The feature has since evolved under my team's guidance, and is now
            core to how many of our customers plan their campaigns. It's become
            the foundation for how we bring predictive modeling into the hands
            of everyday marketers.

            Next Best Action identifies underperforming journeys and recommends
            specific ways to re-engage audiences—turning AI insights into guided,
            actionable steps.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the primary design stakeholder, I focused on ensuring the
            experience felt clear, useful, and seamlessly integrated into a
            marketer's workflow. I worked closely with the team to shape early
            concepts, provide iterative feedback, and protect the bar for quality
            through launch.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project asked us to think differently, about what it means to
            give marketers a sense of momentum. Done right, AI shouldn't feel
            like magic. It should feel like having a teammate who always knows
            the next right move.

            <strong>Generative AI:</strong>
            Journey Assist is the market's first generative AI-powered journey
            builder. It allows marketers to describe the experience they want to
            create in plain language and generates a customizable journey map,
            ready for refinement.
          </p>

          <p>
            I served as executive sponsor for this project, helping ensure that
            quality remained high from concept through launch. I supported the
            team with regular design reviews, in-depth customer research, and
            rich, high-fidelity prototyping.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project was as much about how we worked as what we shipped—tight
            feedback loops, collaboration between design and DSML, and a deep
            focus on clarity and trust.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since launch, Journey Assist has made it dramatically easier for new
            users to create sophisticated campaigns, and showed us what's
            possible when generative UX is done with care.
