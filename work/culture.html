            Great design happens when people feel safe to take risks, push
            boundaries, and grow together. At Iterable, I cultivated a culture
            rooted in trust and collaboration, enabling our team to thrive in a
            fast-paced, distributed environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Product Design Team Charter reflects these shared principles:
            communicate candidly, support each other, and raise the bar for
            quality, all while staying kind and inclusive. This culture helped us
            achieve a <strong>team engagement score of 100%</strong>, 21
            percentage points above the company average.

          <p>
            Trust and excellence go hand in hand. I worked across product,
            engineering, and customer teams to ensure design was seen as a
            dependable, non-blocking partner. By facilitating collaboration and
            creating clarity, I helped the team consistently deliver with precision
            and creativity. Our focus on Clarity, Autonomy, Meaning, Progress, and
            Social Inclusion ensured the team felt supported and energized, even
            while holding ourselves to best-in-class standards.

            This culture of trust shaped not just how we worked with each other
            but also how we designed for our users. We led with empathy, deeply
            understanding customer needs and challenges, while upholding a strong
            sense of accountability to ship thoughtful, high-quality experiences.
            Internally and externally, trust has been the cornerstone of raising
            the bar for what design can achieve.
