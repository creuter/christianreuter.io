           <strong>Predictive AI:</strong>
           One of our earliest AI features, Predictive Goals helps marketers
           forecast whether a campaign is likely to hit its intended goal—before
           it ends.

            The idea was born during a design sprint I facilitated with data

            Predictive Goals became the foundation for how we bring predictive

           As the primary design stakeholder, I focused on ensuring the
           experience felt clear, useful, and seamlessly integrated into a
           marketer's workflow. I worked closely with the team to shape early
           concepts, provide iterative feedback, and protect the bar for quality

           This project asked us to think differently: not just about showing
           data, but about what it means to give marketers a sense of momentum.
           Done right, AI shouldn't feel like magic—it should feel like having a
           teammate who always knows the next right move.

           <strong>Generative AI:</strong>
           Journey Assist is the market's first generative AI-powered journey
           builder. It allows marketers to describe the experience they want to
           create in plain language—and generates a customizable journey map,
           ready for refinement.

           I served as executive sponsor for this project, helping ensure that
           quality remained high from concept through launch. I supported the
           team with regular design reviews, in-depth customer research, and
           rich, high-fidelity prototyping.

          <p>
           This project was as much about how we worked as what we shipped—tight
           feedback loops, collaboration between design and DSML, and a deep
           focus on clarity and trust.
          </p>

          <p>
           Since launch, Journey Assist has made it dramatically easier for new
           users to create sophisticated campaigns—and showed us what's possible
           when generative UX is done with care.
